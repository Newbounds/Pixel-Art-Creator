# Pixel-Art-Creator
A fun little pixel art tool for when you're bored.

### Welcome

The current state of the file is plain HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I started out wanting to create an app using only vanilla JavaScript just for fun and then it turned into this.

### Functionality

Currently, you can draw a transparent pixel, or a colored pixel. I hope to create more and more functionality in the future and cool little art you see when you open the file showcases some of the functionality to come.

Have fun and enjoy!
