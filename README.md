A fun little pixel art tool for when you're bored.

### Welcome

The current state of the file is plain HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I started out wanting to create an app using only vanilla JavaScript just for fun and then it turned into this.

### Functionality

Currently, you can draw a transparent pixel, or a colored pixel.

Updates will include:

*  Delete a pixel after drawn
*  Rotate the angle of pixels before you draw
*  Change opacity of the pixel
*  Lock a pixel angle to draw a straight line
*  Plus much more!

Have fun and enjoy!
